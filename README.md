# VoiceAssistant

A virtual assistant or intelligent personal assistant is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual. Sometimes the term "chatbot" is used to refer to virtual assistants generally or specifically those accessed by online chat (or in some cases online chat programs that are for entertainment and not useful purposes).

## Prerequisites:

#### Python
- [Python downloads(Use the latest verion of Python)](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## About:
- **Speech-Recognition** : Speech recognition is the ability of a machine or program to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert them to a machine-readable format. Rudimentary speech recognition software has a limited vocabulary of words and phrases, and it may only identify these if they are spoken very clearly.

- **Pyttsx** :
Pyttsx for python3 [ Offline text to speech for python3]

Pyttsx is a good text to speech conversion library in python but it was written only in python2 untill now ! Even some fair amount of googling didnâ€™t help much to get a tts library compatible with Python3.

```

- **OpenCV** : OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. Python is a general purpose programming language started by Guido van Rossum(Author of Python) that became very popular very quickly, mainly because of its simplicity and code readability.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
